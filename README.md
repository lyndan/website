    <title>About me</title>

this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes
it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that
you do not know where to start with. <br>Let me give a try to see what
kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope
that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so
different. Here it goes.<br><br>I am a person who is positive
about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see,
and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I
like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the
sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to
feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from
the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank
mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle
of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in
autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get
up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people.I
like country's peace, I like metropolis noise; I like the beautiful
west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in <br>Champaign. I
like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and
romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I
like to laugh.<br><br>I always wanted to be a great writer, like
Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote
"John Christopher". They have influenced millions of people through
their books.<br>I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like
William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read people's mind. Of
course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who
does<br>some learning, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.<br><br>This is a brief introduction of myself. If you are interested in knowing more, read my<a style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);" href="www.lindaikeji.blogspot.com" target="_blank">blog</a> or take a look at my<a style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);" href="www.lyndanwankwo.carbonmade.com">pictures</a>. Do not expect too much, and keep your sense of humor.<br>BTW, I came across <a style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);" href="http://art.yale.edu/">this</a> horrible website, and <a style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);" href="Question%202.html">here</a>'s why i think it sucks.</body></html>
